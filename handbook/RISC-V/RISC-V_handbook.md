# Notes for handbook of RISC-V

## Basic integer instruction
### Format
- The RISC-V has 6 kinds of basic instructions:
    + R: Register operation
    + I: The load operation and short immediate operand
    + S: The store operation of memmory access
    + B: Conditional jump
    + U: Long immediate operand
    + J: Unconditional jump




- The length of RISC-V instructions are all 32bits. It means the instructions of RISC-V are more simple than x86 and AMD which as different instruction format.
- RISC-V has 3 register operands 


## Assembly language
    Normally the computer has four step to execute the program: C++/C --> Assembly program --> Object --> Library --> Excutable file
