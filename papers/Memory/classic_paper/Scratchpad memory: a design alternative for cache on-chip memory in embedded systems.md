## Summary: 
### Problem:
- No previous work compare the energy and area behavior between cache scratch pad.

### Key idea: 
- scratch pad and memeory (see blog/architecture/cache)
- The scratch pad do not have ins cache, hence the area could be evaluated by only decoder, data array, some control logic and other logic.
- Cache has data area and instruction area.
- Compare with cache res in CACTI and evaluate the sratch pad by transister behavior.

### Takeaways: 
- This is a early paper to simulate memeory and there is several comparison about the cache and scratch pad. It shows a intuitive difference in cache and scratch pad performance.
- It is good reference to show the diff of cache and sratch pad.
