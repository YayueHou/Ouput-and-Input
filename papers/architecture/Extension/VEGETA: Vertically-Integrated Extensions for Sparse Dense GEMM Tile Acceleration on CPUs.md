## Summary: 
### Problem:
1. Though most DL tasks are offloaded to domain-specific accelerators and GPU, CPU are sometimes more efficiency and cheaper for edge devices and modest-size tasks.
2. Most work focus on dense GEMM but there is demand on sparse matrix multiplication.
3. Challenges:
    - General purpose CPUs are sensitive to hardware devoted to improving a subset of workload.
    - New functional unit CPU should be able to support a wide variety of use cases.
    - CPUs need programmability support to support sparsity unlike DMA engines.
