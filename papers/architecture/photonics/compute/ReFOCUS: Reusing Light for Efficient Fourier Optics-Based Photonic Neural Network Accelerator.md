## Summary: 
### Problem:
- Free-space photonic neural network accelerator
    - Those kind of accelerators are often bulky and inflexible.
- On-chip photonic neural network accelerator
    - MZI and MRR based accelerators
        - The major bottle neck of such kind of accelerator is the conversion between digital and analog domian.
        - These accelerator achieves a low compute-to-conversion ratio due to the small arrary size because of relatively larger photonic components and limitation of WDM.
    - Directly computing accelerator
        -
