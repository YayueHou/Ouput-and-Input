## Summary: 
### Problem:
- Moore's law nad frequency limitation
### Photonic matrix multiplication method
- Plane light conversion(PLC)
    - Y = WX
    - incident vector along X pass a cylindrical lens and was replicated along Y axis
    - The replicated light pass a spatial diffraction plane whose transmission matrix is W.
    - combine X direction beams and get final output vector along Y axis.
- Mach-Zehnder interferometer(MZI)
- Wavelength division multiplication(WDM)
