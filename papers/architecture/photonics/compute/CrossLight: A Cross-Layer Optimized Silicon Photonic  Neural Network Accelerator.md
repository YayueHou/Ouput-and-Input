## Summary: 
### Problem:
- Fabrication process and thermel variation adversely affected the robustness of photonic accelerator.
    - crosstalk in thermal and noise limited the resolution(accuracy) and scalability
    - Process variation introduces resonant drift.
        - Compensation with EO(electro-optic) is faster and energy cheap, but has a small adjust range
        - Compensation with TO(thermo-opti) has higher power and lantency with large adjust range.
    - As MRR number and wavelength numbers increase introduce noise due to crosstalk and splitter loss.

### Background
- Noncoherent photonic accelerator
    - Broadcast and Weight protocol, which use WDM, photonic multiplexors and photodetectors.
    - Aplly MR to weight optical signals. 
- Coherent photonic 
    - manipulate electrical field amplitude rather than signal power, typically use single wavelength.
    - Apply amplitude attenuation proportional to the weight value to weight the signal.
    - coherently accumulated by cascaded Y-junction combiners.
