## Summary:
* Problem: Compare of metal and optical interconnection.(early assmuption)

* Key idea:
	- Physics:
		1.Optical no resistance limit for bit rate; high frequency for WDM
		2.No Relative voltage.(low threshole?)
		3.Precise clock, low latency
	- Requirements:
		1. free-space/waveguide/WDM to approach large data rate.


## Takeaways: Some details about Energy and Density of chips.

## weaknesses: Speculative

* ( Too old to be follow up)
