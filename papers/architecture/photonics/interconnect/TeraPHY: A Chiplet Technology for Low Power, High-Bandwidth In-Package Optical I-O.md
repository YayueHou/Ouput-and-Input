## Summary:
### Problem: off-chip and off-board communication with Optical I/O

### Key idea:
- TeraPHY technology: WDM with ring-resonator based modulators
- In 45nm CMOS	

### Takeaways:
- with EMIB packaging(2.5D)
- with Serdes array (AIB/optical channel)

## Strengths: tape out

## weaknesses: a simple I/O (only chip-chip and no broadcast and small scale)
