## Summary: 
### Problem:
- The access of a single values has the same cost as accessing the block of the value, hence, regular data access is prefered. Original butterfly has a non block-alighed data access pattern, which seems unefficient.
- The flat butterfly is as expressive as the normal butterfly and better expressiveness than normal random pattern. Low-rank matrix are also needed to increase expressiveness
- The multiplication of matrix of factors are difficult to parallelize. Flat butterly replace the multiplication with addition.
