# The difference between several parallel architectures
One design trend of computer system is to compute in parallel. There are various architecture which could achieve a high eficiency benefit from the architecture. In this section, several classical architecure appears in processor will be introduced and compared. Vector processor, Super scalar rpocessor, GPU are now contained.

计算机系统设计的一大趋势是并行计算，很多架构都通过并行性获得了高效率，这一章节，我们会介绍并比较一些经典的处理器架构。目前包含向量处理器，超标量处理器以及GPU和一些专门功能的架构，比如脉动矩阵（SA）
