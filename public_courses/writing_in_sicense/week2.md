# Writing in the Science 
## Use the active voice  
1. Active voice
   - S + V + O 
   - Agent + V + Recipient
2. Passive voice
   -  Passive voice sometimes hide the agent(Who did this?)
### Why use active voice
1. Emphasize authors responsibility
2. Increase readability
3. Reduce ambiguity
### When should use passive voice?
1. When recipient is more important such as Methedology
2. Not in introduction or discuss.

### We? I?
1. It is OK to use We and I to apply active voice.
2. Aoiding personal pronouns does not lead to objective.

### Passive/Active voice practice
1. A recommendation was made by the DSMB committee that the study be halted.
   - DSMB committee recommend that the study be halted.


2. Major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects were found.
    - We found the major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects
    - The two study subjects differed in reaction times.

3. It was concluded by the editors that the data had been falsified by the authors.
    - The editors concluded that the author falsified their data.
  
4. The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. 
    - NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star

5. Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.
    - Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable (not different).

## Use strong verbs
1. Verbs make sentences go.
2. Use more 'to be'
3. Don't replace words by nouns.
4. Verbs should be near to subject.

## Grammer tips
1. 'data' is plural.
2. affect is verb, effect is a noun.
3. compare to (point similarity in different things)/ compare with (point differences between similar things. More commen in science.)
4. That is used when having a restrictive or essential cause; which is used when having non restrictive or non essential cause.
5. Singukar antecedents (don't use they/their when subject is singular. Use plural to avoid gender choice).

## Practice
1. The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience.  A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students’ performances.
    - We has not realized some teachers' fear that students would learn statistics poorly if they were permitted to use canned computer programs. Students' performance has remains same when monitering the achievement levels before and after introducing computers in the teaching of our course. (MA)
    - Many teachers feared that the use of canned computer programs would prevent studetns from learning statistics. We monitored student achievements levels before and after the introduction of computers in our course and found no detriments in performance.


2. Review of each center’s progress in recruitment is important to ensure that the cost involved in maintaining each center’s participation is worthwhile.
    - We should review each center's recruitment progress to make sure its continued participation is cost-effective.
 
3. It should be emphasized that these proportions generally are not the result of significant increases in moderate and severe injuries, but in many instances reflect mildly injured persons not being seen at a hospital.
    - These proportions reflect mildly injured persons not being seen at a hospital but not increases the moderate and severe injuries.
    - Shifting proportions in injury severity may reflect stricter hospital admission criteria rather than true increases in moderate and severe injuries.

4. Important studies to examine the descriptive epidemiology of autism, including the prevalence and changes in the characteristics of the population over time, have begun. 
    - Studies have begun to describe the epidemiology of autism, including the prevalence and changes in the characteristics.


5. There are multiple other mechanisms that are important, but most of them are suspected to only have a small impact or are only important because of impact on one of the three primary mechanisms.
    - Most mechanisms has small impact or impact because of one of the three primary mechanisms.
    - Multiple other mechanisms play only a small role or work by impacting one of the three primary mechanisms.


6. After rejecting paths with poor signal-to-noise ratios, we were left with 678 velocity measurements of waves with 7.5 seconds period and 891 measurements of 15 second waves. 
    - We left 678 velocity measurements of waves with 7.5 seconds period and 891 measurements of 15 second waves by rejecting path with poor SNR.
    - Rejecting path with poor SNR left 678 velocity measurements of 7.5 seconds waves and 891 of 15 second waves.

7. It is suspected that the importance of temperature has more to do with impacting rates of other reactions than being a mechanism of disinfection itself since ponds are rarely hot enough for temperature alone to cause disinfection.
    - Ponds are rarely hot enough for temperature alone to cause disinfection; thus, the effect of temperature is likely mediated through its impact on the rates of other reactions.

9. It was assumed that due to reduced work at the joints of the lower limbs and less energy loss in the prosthetic leg, running with the dedicated prostheses allows for maximum sprinting at lower metabolic costs than in the healthy ankle joint complex.
    - The prosthetic leg reduces work and energy loss compared with a healthy ankle joint, which may lead to lower metabolic costs during maximum sprinting.
