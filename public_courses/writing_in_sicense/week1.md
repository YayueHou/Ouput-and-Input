### What not to do
- Ask yourself:
    1. Readable? Understandable?
    2. Interesting?
    3. Inform/Obscure?
- Try to use verb instead of series nouns (verbs move readers on but nouns slow readers down)
- Complex idea does not mean complex language
- Scientific writing should also be interesting.


### Principles of effective writing. 
1. Use verbs instead of nouns
2. Avoid using vague words.
3. Avoid using unnecessary jargon and acronyms.
4. Note paasive voice. Avoid long distance between subject and verb.

## How to cut clutter?
### What should be cut?
1. Dead weight words and phrases. (as is well known?)
2. Empty words and phrases. (important, basic...)
3. Long words that could be shortten.
   - have an effect on = affect
   - due to fact that = because
   - a majority of = most
4. Unnecessary jargona nd acronyms.
5. Repetitive words/phrases. (challenges/difficultities)
6. Adverbs.

### Tips about cutting clutters
1. Eliminate negatives
    - She was not often right = she was usually wrong.
2. Eliminate there are/there is
3. Omit needless prepositions
    - The meeting happened on Monday = The meeting happened Monday.

## Practices
1. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease.
    - Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against (MA: defense) Alzheimer's Diseases.

2. Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.
    - Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the newborns(neonatal population)

3. Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays a role in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility. 
    - P53 againsts malignant transformation and develops in aging, differentiation, and fertility.
    - Besides preveting cancer, P53 also plays roles in aging, differentiation, and fertility.

4. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.  
    - Injuries to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive (in medical treat).

5. An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities.
    - An IQ test measures an individuals' verbal, reasoning, or motor and spatial capabilities.

6. As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.
    - Figue 2 shows that (As shown in Figure 2), return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up is associated with two electron trajectories.
    - Figure 2 shows that s return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up yields two electron trajectories.
